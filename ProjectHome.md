The classic game Bomberman will be developed with Python and Pygame.
First time i wrote the code was in 2008 with my friends (Pedro Rosanes and George Lucas) as a project for a Programming Course at UFRJ.
The code was written in C but now i'm trying to convert it to Python with some changes in modeling.
